# CS-300 Module 8 Journal

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

In the projects, I was able to implement a course planner program that can read course data from a file and store it in a linked-list hash table data structure. The program should provide a menu that allows users to load the data into the data structure, print a list of all the courses in the Computer Science department, print the title and prerequisites of individual courses, insert courses from input file to the data structure, search for specific courses, and sort the course information in alphanumberic order from lowest to highest. 

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

To write the course planner software, the first step is I did was design the code to read the course data file and store it in the program. The program should then provide a menu of options for users to choose from, such as loading the data, printing a list of courses, printing course information, or exiting the program. The code should also sort and print course lists, and print course information for specific courses. Additionally, the program should follow best practices for coding, such as displaying error messages and using clear naming conventions. It's important to understand data structures because they determine how the data is stored and managed in the program.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
