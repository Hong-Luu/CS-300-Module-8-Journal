# CS-300 Module 8 Journal

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

In the projects, I was able to implement a course planner program that can read course data from a file and store it in a linked-list hash table data structure. The program should provide a menu that allows users to load the data into the data structure, print a list of all the courses in the Computer Science department, print the title and prerequisites of individual courses, insert courses from input file to the data structure, search for specific courses, and sort the course information in alphanumberic order from lowest to highest. 

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

To write the course planner software, the first step is I did was design the code to read the course data file and store it in the program. The program should then provide a menu of options for users to choose from, such as loading the data, printing a list of courses, printing course information, or exiting the program. The code should also sort and print course lists, and print course information for specific courses. Additionally, the program should follow best practices for coding, such as displaying error messages and using clear naming conventions. It's important to understand data structures because they determine how the data is stored and managed in the program.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

To overcome roadblocks in a programming project, it's helpful for me to break the problem into smaller parts, understand the project requirements, and seek help from others or online resources. I think it is important to remain patient and positive, even if the task seems challenging such as when I was facing errors while running the program. By staying focused and willing to learn, I think there is a chance to overcome obstacles and complete the project successfully. I tried to remember that programming can be difficult at times, but with persistence and a good attitude, I can find a solution to the problem. 

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

By working on this project, I was able to learn how to design software and develop programs and it gave me a chance to apply what I learned in previous coursework to a real-life problem. I might face challenges while working on the project, but it helped me improve my problem-solving skills and feel more confident in my abilities. By successfully finishing the project, I feel better prepared to handle future programming challenges and be able to create good quality software.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

Working on a programming project like this helps me evolve my approach to writing programs that are maintainable, readable and adaptable. Throughout the project, I have learned about best practices in coding, such as the importance of using clear and concise naming conventions, adding in-line comments to enhance code readability, and organizing code to be easy to understand and modify. I also learned about techniques for testing and debugging code to ensure its quality and reliability. By applying these best practices to my work on the project, I think it helped me have a better understanding of how to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I can apply this knowledge to future programming projects and improve the quality of the software I produce.
